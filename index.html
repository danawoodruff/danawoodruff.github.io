  <h1>Dana's Bio</h1>
  <p>My professional career began on nineteenth century square rigged shooners.</p>

  <p>The Californian, Tole Mour, Adventuress, and the Pride of Baltimore II are examples of my schooner life.</p>
  <p>My undergraduate degrees are from the United States Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Pt, NY. As one of our <br>
    five federal service academies I recieved a congressional appointment to attend.  The military structure encouraged<br>
    a degree of organization and precision.  I was one of nine double majors in Marine Engineering and Marine Transportation.</p>
  <p>I worked as an engineer aboard tankers, cruise ships, and container ships before switching gears and vetting for oil majors.<br>
    There I worked with projects as diverse as North Sea platform construction and STS ops in Uruguay.</p>

    For the last four years i have worked as a freelance auditor for the military and oil and gas.
  <p>Finance peaked my interest and my company sent me to Harvard University for my graduate degree.</p>

  <p>Finance naturally led me to Data Analytics and I decided to attend a six month bootcamp at Rice University.</p>
  <p>My love, though, is with cars. I've had many over the years beginning with Jeeps and now with a Tesla "Lucy"<br>
    and a Bentley coupe "Walter"</p>
